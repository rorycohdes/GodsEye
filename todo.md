- [ ] populate your readme file with steps for setting up this RAG

- [ ] change docker for production

- [✔️] remove .venv from git history if possible

- [ ] create a branch for different embeddings

- [ ] potentially use google embeddings

- [ ] update the docker file for security

- [✔️] use the compare feature to compare changes between branches of the repository https://github.com/daveebbelaar/pgvectorscale-rag-solution/tree/setup

- [✔️] used interactive mode for data science

- [✔️] messed with the settings so that interactive mode uses the correct kernel

- [✔️] I need to not get "No module named" error in interactive mode. The change to the python path such that is the backend folder fixed the issue

- [ ] Customize the RAG system to take your custom data

- [ ] Write functionality to use relation database

- [✔️] Not scrape companies indefinitely. Maybe for the future. I want to scrape like a hundred and all the data of the company and the return the name of all the companies scrape in that batch for debugging purposes. I want to peridoically scrape a 100 companies. So scrape 100 return data, scrape 100 return data so on

- [✔️] maybe while scraping the terminal could prompt me to return scrape data while it is actively scraping

- [✔️] create a new table or index wtv and then seed the table with data that you would get from ycomb and

- [ ] set up queries to return that data to the front end

- [ ] install requirement.txt file for the newly added packages
